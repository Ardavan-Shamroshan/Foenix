# Foenix
Foenix Framework 1.1.1

Hi, I am Ardavan Shamroshan and this project is Foenix Framework.
Foenix is a tiny personal framework that makes your php coding very modern and enjoyable.
Foenix is designed very much like Laravel and is very suitable for developing small and fast yet powerful websites.

Foenix is developed with php 7.4.

Foenix uses a query builder and ORM system with Softdeletes support, similar to Laravel eloquent, for ease of working with the database as well as secure coding.

Foenix also uses a Laravel-like blade molding engine implemented by the view builder system.

Foenix also uses a very fast and Laravel-like routing system, which is one of its strengths.

In addition to the above mentioned, Phoenix has many attractive features and facilities such as widely used helpers, Request Validation system, Session authentication system, autoloading system, use of many widely used packages such as guzzleHttp, phpmailer, Symfony, intervention, etc.

With Foenix, a real estate ad website has been developed, which I put on my GateHub page called amlak_ads, and by examining that project, you can see the power of Foenix.

And I, Ardavan Sham Roshan, am very happy to be able to introduce Foenix to you :)
